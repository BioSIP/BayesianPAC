Bayesian estimation of Phase-Amplitude Coupling
# BayesianPAC

This repository contains the core implementation of the **Bayesian Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC)** model presented in our manuscript on EEG-based analysis of reading difficulties in children. The approach uses probabilistic modeling to estimate directional connectivity between EEG channels while accounting for uncertainty in both data and inference.

The method has been developed and tested using EEG data collected under controlled auditory stimulation at 4.8, 16, and 40â€¯Hz, with the aim of identifying functional coupling differences between typically developing children and those with reading difficulties.

## ðŸ“‚ Included Notebooks

### `BPAC_OneSubject.ipynb`

This notebook performs the full analysis pipeline for a **single subject**:
- Loads PAC values and time fragments.
- Computes conditional probabilities using non-parametric Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).
- Applies Bayesian inference to estimate directed PAC connections.
- Outputs a subject-level probability matrix for directional connectivity.

### `BPAC_GroupsComparison.ipynb`

This notebook takes individual probability matrices (from multiple subjects) and:
- Compares connectivity patterns between two groups (e.g., controls vs. dyslexia).
- Performs statistical testing (e.g., z-scores, permutation tests).
- Outputs group-level summary figures and statistical results.

## ðŸ“Œ Why Jupyter Notebooks?

We chose Jupyter Notebooks to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility. This format allows users to:
- Read and execute the analysis step-by-step.
- Modify parameters interactively.
- Visualize results directly within the workflow.

Researchers can adapt the pipeline to their own EEG datasets by editing and running the notebooks in any standard Python environment.
